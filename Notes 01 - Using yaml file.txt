First time setup
    Getting the yaml file from airflow official website
        wget https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.2.3/docker-compose.yaml
    
    Make a local dir and navigate to it
        cd ~/Development/Project/airflow_aws_spark/

    Make the airflow dirctories
        echo "Spinning up local Airflow infrastructure"
        rm -rf logs;
        mkdir logs;
        rm -rf temp;
        mkdir temp;
        rm -rf dags;
        mkdir dags;
        rm -rf data;
        mkdir data;
    
fireup docker, wait 5 mins after this to let Airflow containers reach a healthy state
        docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
